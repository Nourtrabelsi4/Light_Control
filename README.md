# Light_Control_on_STM32
After completing a session on STM microcontrollers and the Internet of Things (IoT), I applied what I learned to a Light Controller project using STM32. The project demonstrated how an LED can be controlled by detecting and responding to changes in the surrounding light environment, highlighting key IoT and embedded system concepts
